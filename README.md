**Playerless Continued** is an updated continuation of the original [Playerless mod by jadc](https://modrinth.com/mod/playerless).

This mod ensures that mobs drop exp and loot regardless of how they die. Whether killed by lava, fall damage, entity cramming, or any other non-player damage source, they will drop their exp and loot exactly as if a player had killed them.

## Usage Environment

* **Multiplayer:** This mod is **Server-Side Only**. It does not need to be installed on clients to work.
* **Singleplayer:** Simply install it into your mods folder and it works locally.


## Compatibility

* **Minecraft Versions:** 1.21.1 - 1.21.11
* **Mod Loader:** Fabric
* **Dependencies:** [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api)

## Installation

2.  Download the latest `.jar` from the [Releases](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/REPO_NAME/releases) tab.
3.  Place the file (and Fabric API) into your server's or game's `mods` folder.
4.  Launch the game.
