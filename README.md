**Playerless Continued** is an updated continuation of the original [Playerless mod by jadc](https://modrinth.com/mod/playerless).

This mod ensures that mobs drop exp and loot regardless of how they die. Whether killed by lava, fall damage, entity cramming, or any other non-player damage source, they will drop their exp and loot exactly as if a player had killed them.
